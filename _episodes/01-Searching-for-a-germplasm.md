So simply, we go to the germplasm search and click on the image of the targeted crop, then the genus will be filled by default, and we are encouraged to choose the species name specifically to narrow down the results. Also, there is a category drop down to select which category the germplasm belongs to. The more information we put in, the easier it is to find the individual we are looking for.

We are using 2545S as an example to show the pedigree chart. The legend here shows us how each selection looks like. The shaded nodes are clickable, this means there is parental data for them. By double clicking on them, you are able to trace the full tree diagram for 2545S.
