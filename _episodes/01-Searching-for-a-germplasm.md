So simply, you go to the germplasm search and click on the image of the targeted crop, then the genus will be filled by default, and you are encouraged to choose the species name specifically to narrow down the results. Also, there is a category drop down to select which category the germplasm belongs to. The more information you put in, the easier it is to find the individual you are looking for.
